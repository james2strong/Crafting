			<h2>Welcome!</h2>
			<p>This blog will be showing the enjoyment I have found with the hobby of crafting
				for Dungeons and Dragons. Although it is not required to physically build anything
				to play D&D, I have found as much fun in the building as I have in playing the game.
				It is my hope that seeing what I made with little skill or training will inspire others
				to pick up a new hobby or interest.</p>

			<p>I started with painting miniatures, even though I've never thought of myself as artistic. 
				The models would never make it to competitions or be on display for anyone except me, so I 
				didn't worry about doing it wrong.  I watched some tutorials on Youtube and looked at other people's 
				work online.  Then I just put paint on a brush and put the brush on the models.
