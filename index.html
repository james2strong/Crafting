    <h3>The Goal</h3>
    <p>
       This blog will be showing the enjoyment I have found with the hobby of crafting
       for Dungeons and Dragons. Although it is not required to physically build anything
       to play <img src="Images/logo.jpg" alt="D&D logo" width="25" height="15">, I have found as much fun in the building as I have in playing the game.
       It is my hope that seeing what I made with little skill or training will inspire others
       to pick up a new hobby or interest.
