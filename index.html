    <h3>The Goal</h3>
    <p>
       This blog will be showing the enjoyment I have found with the hobby of crafting
       for Dungeons and Dragons. Although it is not required to physically build anything
       to play <img src="Images/logo.jpg" alt="D&D logo" width="25" height="15">, I have found as much fun in the building as I have in playing the game.
       It is my hope that seeing what I made with little skill or training will inspire others
       to pick up a new hobby or interest.

    <h3>My History</h3>

    <p>I've known about D&D most of my life.  I tried to play as a teenager, but I was not able to get started with a group.
        In 2017 my nephew reintroduced the game to my family and we were quickly hooked.  Soon my wife, daughter, and I were playing a weekly game.  I quickly realized I would need
        physical representations of the characters we were controling in our imaginations.
