# My Hobbies
My project website shows some examples of crafting hobbies that I have enjoyed for several years.
The project shows the following concepts learned from the Code Louisville program:
1. Two different media queries that change the layout of the page based on the size of the view screen.
2. Flexbox was used to move the navigation menu from center column to a right hand row according to changing screen size.
3. The CSS universal selector "contains" was used to style all images of miniatures and foam to the same size, border, and margin.  
4. I used a javacript function to switch between two images of the same painted miniature.  As you mouse over the images, the function flips from a front view to a rear view.
